			<p style="text-align:justify; ">Dear friends, It gives me immense pleasure to bring you the 4th edition of LNMIIT Model United Nations, to be held on 7th-8th of January, 2017 at LNMIIT, Jaipur. It is my privilege to lead the team which will be your host for this conference. Every MUN that I have been a part of, has strengthened the belief, that an MUN is the most complete form of debate. It is a great opportunity to enhance skills in research, writing, public speaking, problem solving, consensus building and crisis management. It gives you the honor of being an ambassador of a country. More importantly, it entrusts you with the task of solving global issues. With LNMIIT MUN, we intend to provide you a platform to discuss and deliberate on realistic issues through an assemblage of committees, led by a brilliant Executive Board. The team is committed to make your experience enjoyable and rewarding through a structured environment. We hope to make the conference a landmark MUN and aspire for your support in doing so. I welcome you again and look forward to see you all here at LNMIIT MUN 2017.</p>
